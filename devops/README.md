# Dev Ops

This contains some sample scripts that you can use to quickly pull up a node for a testnet.
They are designed for ease of use and simplicity rather than complexity. This is just bash scripts,
designed for Ubuntu, so they should be easy to port to any other system.

Some changes you may wish to make if you deploy this on a value-bearing network:

* Use native binaries rather than docker
* Activate a firewall
* Use hardware key signer
* Further, tune the node's config.toml
* Further OS-level security updates

However, for early testnets this should be enough to get started.
