# Set up a Node with cosmovisor

These instructions work for a machine running Ubuntu 20.04. 

Optimal Requirements: 2 CPU, 4 GB RAM, 40 GB SSD.

Cosmovisor is a software tooling that handles automatic swap of node binaries at a specified time
by a `software-upgrade` proposal.
These scripts help setting up wasmd binary and cosmovisor configurations.

First, copy all files from this directory to the machine:

`scp -r ./* root@1.2.3.4:`

Also, copy the proper env for the testnet you choose:

`scp ../../../musselnet/defaults.env root@1.2.3.4:`

## Installing

First, source all the defaults: `source defaults.env`

Then you may want to set the following variables locally:

* `MONIKER` - this is the moniker you use for the node. it should be unique and descriptive (required)
* `WASMD_HOME` - this is the directory where all the data is stored. Default `/root`
* `WASMD_VERSION` - version of the wasmd binary that will be run initially
* `COSMOVISOR_VERSION` - version of cosmovisor binary. Follows cosmos-sdk versioning (required)
* `COSMOVISOR_SOURCE_DIR` - cosmovisor source code download directory. Default `/etc/`
* `COSMOVISOR_BINARY_DIR` - cosmovisor binary directory. Default `/usr/local/bin`

Then run it like: `MONIKER=my-name-here ./install.sh`

The script must be run as root. If you are not logged in as root, try `sudo -E install.sh`

Running this will set up all dependencies, create a local wasmd config for the proper testnet and will run node.

## Configuring

You will want to set up some nodes to connect to. The simplest (and restart safest) way to do so
is to edit `config/config.toml` in your chain-specific config dir.

You will want to set one or more of the following, all under `[p2p]`:

* `seeds` - a seed node to connect to for other peers
* `persistent_peers` - a peer to connect with everytime we restart
* `private_peers` - node_ids from above nodes that we do not want to gossip

You can use `$SEED_NODE` (from `defaults.env`) as either a seed (preferred) or a persistent peer
in order to get attached. These all look like `${node_id}@${ip}:${port}`. Node_id is a hash of the
public key, so you can recognize the same machine if it moves ips.

To get the `node_id` of your current node, run `./node_id.sh`

Remember to allow or disallow rpc endpoints for sentry and validators.

## Systemd

If you wish to run this under systemd, then run `services.sh` to set up a default config to auto-restart the node.
This will install a service file with the binary name under eg `/etc/systemd/system/cosmovisor.service`,
enable it to start on reboot, and then start it running.

You may also run this manually or use another supervisor and skip this step.

## Downloading new wasmd versions for upgrades

Set environment variables:

* `NEW_VERSION` - git tag or version of the new software(required)
* `UPGRADE_NAME` - name of the upgrade that is in the proposal(required) 

then run `./get_upgrade_bin.sh`.
This will checkout the wasmd, branch build the binary and place it to right path.

cosmovisor will swap binaries at the specified upgrade time.

## Staking

Once your node has caught up, if you want to become a validator, just delegate some funds to it.

First, make sure you can connect to it and control an account with some funds.
Example for musselnet, values taken from `defaults.env`, `validator` being your local name for a key with funds behind it:

```bash
wasmd config chain-id musselnet
wasmd config node https://rpc.musselnet.cosmwasm.com:443

wasmd query account $(wasmd keys show -a validator)
```

And get your pubkey from the validator machine:

```
root@validator$ ./show_validator.sh
# copy this as VAL_PUBKEY in your local shell
```

Then see [testnet instructions](https://docs.cosmwasm.com/testnets/testnets.html) or just run a command like:

```bash
wasmd tx staking create-validator \
  --amount="100000000ufrites" \
  --pubkey=${VAL_PUBKEY} \
  --moniker=$MONIKER \
  --chain-id=musselnet \
  --commission-rate="0.10" \
  --commission-max-rate="0.20" \
  --commission-max-change-rate="0.01" \
  --min-self-delegation="1" \
  --gas="400000" \
  --fees="5000umayo" \
  --from=validator
```
