# Coral (WIP)

A permissionless network running wasmd 0.9

**Started**: TBA

**Ended**: not yet finished

## Purpose

This is long-term playground network where developers can test their contracts validators test their infrastructure. 
You can relate it to Ethereum's Rinkeby.

## Connecting

The configuration can be [downloaded here](./config).
Please `source config` to get all variable you need.

With those, you can follow the
[official instructions](https://docs.cosmwasm.com/testnets/testnets.html)
 on how to connect to a testnet.
Or just connect your command-line client. In order to build customized wasmd executables `corald` and `coralcli`,
clone `wasmd` repo and run `make build-coral` on the root of the project.

The [genesis file](./genesis.json) is also available here.
